# Annotation of NLI for animal studies

Following the annotation in [SemEval 2023 Task 7](https://sites.google.com/view/nli4ct/), we annotated 31 animals studies with are publicly available at the [Animal Study Registry](https://www.animalstudyregistry.org), i.e., after the embargo phase and used in the publication below:

Mariana Neves, **Bf3R at SemEval-2023 Task 7: a text similarity model for textual entailment and evidence retrieval in clinical trials and animal studies**, SemEval'23, ACL'23, Toronto, Canada.

Unfortunately, the license of most of the studies does not allow the redistribution of the text, thus we publish only four of the studies that we originally used.
